The concept of integration cycles is generalized to 𝑑 dimensions rather straightforwardly as 𝑑 -dimensional integration paths in C 𝑑 that either connect two distinct zeros of 𝑒 -𝑆 or are closed and incontractible. As before, in the model (10) we do not need to worry about the latter, nor about finite zeros, as 𝑒 -𝑆 has no singularities and only vanishes as | 𝑧 𝑖 | →∞ . In particular, there are zeros whenever Re 𝑆 →∞ as | 𝑧 𝑖 | →∞ . To find the independent integration cycles of (10), we shall first determine these zeros.\nIntroducing the real and imaginary parts of 𝑧 𝑖 as 𝑧 𝑖 = 𝑥 𝑖 + i 𝑦 𝑖 , we choose the following -\nFigure 2: Sign of 𝑃 𝜙 , 𝜙 ( 𝑥 𝑦 , 𝜓 ) in (12) in the ( Δ 𝜙, 𝜓 ) plane.

When compared to classical process, quantum provides advantage in runtime, space complexity i.e. number of bits/qubits required for image encoding, but is not sufficient in terms of depth and width of image. With Quantum methods it is quite challenging to handle larger images as circuit design gets complex with increased number of qubits required, leading to addition of noise with inaccurate edge detection and classification results. In this project, we have used gate based quantum statevector and qasm simulator that are slower in performance which in-turn increases the training time for larger datasets and requires splitting of data into smaller sets and recombining to get higher accuracy for larger image pixel and datasets. While running real quantum may provides better performance but it is more exposed to the noise from the devices. As advancements with this projects, our team is working to analyse impact of different noise models on the quantum image encoding circuit and its results when processing smaller pixel as well as large pixel images. Our work in future will include implementing from quantum processed results for image verification with original/real-time images to reach better accuracy.\n## REFERENCES\n- [1] Yue Ruan, Xiling Xue, and Yuanxia Shen.

Our results capture the evolution of the electron's wavefunction at the 2000th time step, illustrating distinct standing wave patterns and probability densities that validate quantum mechanical predictions. Additionally, both 2D and 3D simulations across multiple time steps reveal the dynamic nature of quantum superposition and interference within the well. These findings underscore the method's stability and accuracy, offering a robust tool for exploring quantum phenomena in constrained quantum systems\n\n### **参考文献**\n[1] Numerical_Simulation_of_the_Time-Dependent_Schrodinger_Equation_Using_the_Crank-Nicolson_Method - https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10060\n[2] Quantum_Image_Processing - https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01831\n[3] Quantum_many-body_simulations_with_PauliStrings.jl - https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09654\n[4] Parametrized_constant-depth_quantum_neuron - https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12496\n\n请提供一个专业性的回答。", "completion": ""}

Integration cycles in two dimensions\n\nLet us consider the following straightforward extension of the model (6) to two degrees of freedom, 𝑧 1 and 𝑧 2:\n\n$$S = \\frac { \\lambda _ { l } } { 4 } ( z _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } + z _ { 2 }$$\nwhere we once more parametrize 𝜆 𝑙 as in (6). The concept of integration cycles is generalized to 𝑑 dimensions rather straightforwardly as 𝑑 -dimensional integration paths in C 𝑑 that either connect two distinct zeros of 𝑒 -𝑆 or are closed and incontractible. As before, in the model (10) we do not need to worry about the latter, nor about finite zeros, as 𝑒 -𝑆 has no singularities and only vanishes as | 𝑧 𝑖 | →∞ . In particular, there are zeros whenever Re 𝑆 →∞ as | 𝑧 𝑖 | →∞ . To find the independent integration cycles of (10), we shall first determine these zeros.\nIntroducing the real and imaginary parts of 𝑧 𝑖 as 𝑧 𝑖 = 𝑥 𝑖 + i 𝑦 𝑖 , we choose the following -\nFigure 2: Sign of 𝑃 𝜙 , 𝜙 ( 𝑥 𝑦 , 𝜓 ) in (12) in the ( Δ 𝜙, 𝜓 ) plane.

Integration cycles in two dimensions\n\nLet us consider the following straightforward extension of the model (6) to two degrees of freedom, 𝑧 1 and 𝑧 2:\n\n$$S = \\frac { \\lambda _ { l } } { 4 } ( z _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } + z _ { 2 }$$\nwhere we once more parametrize 𝜆 𝑙 as in (6). The concept of integration cycles is generalized to 𝑑 dimensions rather straightforwardly as 𝑑 -dimensional integration paths in C 𝑑 that either connect two distinct zeros of 𝑒 -𝑆 or are closed and incontractible. As before, in the model (10) we do not need to worry about the latter, nor about finite zeros, as 𝑒 -𝑆 has no singularities and only vanishes as | 𝑧 𝑖 | →∞ . In particular, there are zeros whenever Re 𝑆 →∞ as | 𝑧 𝑖 | →∞ . To find the independent integration cycles of (10), we shall first determine these zeros.\nIntroducing the real and imaginary parts of 𝑧 𝑖 as 𝑧 𝑖 = 𝑥 𝑖 + i 𝑦 𝑖 , we choose the following -\nFigure 2: Sign of 𝑃 𝜙 , 𝜙 ( 𝑥 𝑦 , 𝜓 ) in (12) in the ( Δ 𝜙, 𝜓 ) plane.

{"prompt": "请基于以下上下文，回答用户的问题。\n\n**用户问题：**\nT - carbon 的拓扑特性对量子比特的相干时间会产生怎样的影响？\n\n**上下文：**\nWe are going to use the default PauliNet architecture and change the basis set to the correlation-consistent family [60], starting from cc-pvdz to cc-pv5z. The first step is to define a Molecule object (for example named LiH ) with the geometry of LiH at an internuclear distance of 3 0141132 Bohr, and a total zero . charge and spin. Then, the PauliNet neural network can be initialized for a given basis set, say ccpvdz, from a Hartree-Fock calculation using the function from hf(LiH, basis='cc-pvdz') , meaning that the ansatz contains a single Slater determinant (cfr. Equation (33)) and uses the HF orbitals. After initialization, the network can be trained using the function train(net) , where net is the neural network object returned from the initialization procedure. This is the most expensive part of the calculation, however, the training parameters can be slightly modified to decrease the computation time, and still obtain reasonably optimized network weights (with an uncertainty of around 1 m E h ). We suggest you to use n steps = 500 , batch size = 500 and epoch size = 20 . The last step to obtain the ground state energy of LiH is to call the function evaluate(net) . Similarly to train(net) , evaluate(net) accepts optional parameters defining the number of Monte Carlo sweeps and the length of the Markov chain sampled at each step. For these two, we suggest the following values, n steps = 400 and sample size\n= 800 . Save the obtained energy and the estimated error, and repeat the same process for the other basis sets. The choice of training parameters was such that the optimization does not take too long time. If you want to investigate the effects of the training procedure on the final energy and uncertainty, as an advanced exercise you can modify the values of n steps and batch size in the train(net) function (hint: modify one value at a time to understand their role).\n## 3.2.2 CCSD(T) calculations\nIn this part we are going to perform CCSD(T) calculations in combination with the four basis sets used above. You can use PySCF for performing these calculations, and they should take significantly less time than the PauliNet ones. PySCF has a pretty extensive user guide available online at https://pyscf.org/, with many examples. We suggest you to have a look at it if you get stuck at any point. The first step is again to define the lithium hydride molecule, this time in a data-structure that PySCF understands. This can be done with the function gto.M(...) , which accepts a number of arguments similar to the construction of the Molecule object for the DeepQMC package. Then, you can create a restricted HF instance with rhf = scf.RHF(mol) , where mol is the molecule you just created (hint: make sure to set the correct basis set with mol.basis = 'cc-pvdz' and build it with mol.build() ). The rhf object can be used to create the coupled cluster instance with cc = cc.CCSD(rhf) . The energy for each method can then be obtained by calling .kernel() on the HF and coupled cluster objects, and .ccsd t() for the perturbative triples correction. Save all these energies and repeat the process for all basis sets. If you have a powerful computer, as an additional exercise you can try to compute the full CI energy, however, you will probably be able to get it at most with the triple zeta basis set (hint: for such a small molecule, the CCSD(T) and FCI energies are very similar).\n## 3.2.3 Comparison of PauliNet and CCSD(T)\n- [21] T.

Smolensky (1990), the author suggests using a representation based on tensor product :   Tensor   Product   Representation   (TPR),   to   capture   syntactic bindings across sentences. [49, 50] Tensor product is here understood as the Kronecker product, denoted by . Given two matrices A, B we define A B to be ⊗ ⊗ the block matrix where every element of A is multiplied by B (Fig. 2.1). TPR is a structure where every unit of a sentence can be part of the representation of every constituent. It can be compositionally encoded from the numerical vectors representing the composing words, and hence offers the ideal framework to build-up a structure to embed not only words, but also sentences.\n$$\\begin{array} { c c c } a _ { 1 1 } B & \\cdots & a _ { 1 n } B \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ a _ { m 1 } B & \\cdots & a _ { m n } B \\end{array}$$\nBased on Lambek's pregroup algebra, in Mehrnoosh et al. (2010), the authors introduce the CSC algorithm, which develops another implementation of tensor based representation of the meaning of a sentence. [34] This algorithm can be implemented on a quantum computer. Let the linear map Σ⟨ ii| (Fig. 2.2), which is the sum over all the basis vectors of the space N. We call this linear map a cap . It formally describes the state of log  EPR pairs (a generalization of n quantum entanglement). If the basis is of size n and is orthonormal, the cap can simply be thought of as a row vector of size n 2 , filled of 0, and valued 1 at the positions  ii|. The steps of the CSC algorithm are detailed in Fig. 2.3. ⟨\n$$\\sum _ { i } \\langle i | \\colon =$$\n\nFig. 2.2 (Zeng &amp; Coecke, 2016) : Definition of a cap\n- 1 Compute the tensor product words Wo wk in the order that each word appears in the sentence\n- 2 Construct a linear map that represents the grammatical type reduction by the vectors with the appropriate caps.

Integration cycles in two dimensions\n\nLet us consider the following straightforward extension of the model (6) to two degrees of freedom, 𝑧 1 and 𝑧 2:\n\n$$S = \\frac { \\lambda _ { l } } { 4 } ( z _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } + z _ { 2 }$$\nwhere we once more parametrize 𝜆 𝑙 as in (6). The concept of integration cycles is generalized to 𝑑 dimensions rather straightforwardly as 𝑑 -dimensional integration paths in C 𝑑 that either connect two distinct zeros of 𝑒 -𝑆 or are closed and incontractible. As before, in the model (10) we do not need to worry about the latter, nor about finite zeros, as 𝑒 -𝑆 has no singularities and only vanishes as | 𝑧 𝑖 | →∞ . In particular, there are zeros whenever Re 𝑆 →∞ as | 𝑧 𝑖 | →∞ . To find the independent integration cycles of (10), we shall first determine these zeros.\nIntroducing the real and imaginary parts of 𝑧 𝑖 as 𝑧 𝑖 = 𝑥 𝑖 + i 𝑦 𝑖 , we choose the following -\nFigure 2: Sign of 𝑃 𝜙 , 𝜙 ( 𝑥 𝑦 , 𝜓 ) in (12) in the ( Δ 𝜙, 𝜓 ) plane.

Integration cycles in two dimensions\n\nLet us consider the following straightforward extension of the model (6) to two degrees of freedom, 𝑧 1 and 𝑧 2:\n\n$$S = \\frac { \\lambda _ { l } } { 4 } ( z _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } + z _ { 2 }$$\nwhere we once more parametrize 𝜆 𝑙 as in (6). The concept of integration cycles is generalized to 𝑑 dimensions rather straightforwardly as 𝑑 -dimensional integration paths in C 𝑑 that either connect two distinct zeros of 𝑒 -𝑆 or are closed and incontractible. As before, in the model (10) we do not need to worry about the latter, nor about finite zeros, as 𝑒 -𝑆 has no singularities and only vanishes as | 𝑧 𝑖 | →∞ . In particular, there are zeros whenever Re 𝑆 →∞ as | 𝑧 𝑖 | →∞ . To find the independent integration cycles of (10), we shall first determine these zeros.\nIntroducing the real and imaginary parts of 𝑧 𝑖 as 𝑧 𝑖 = 𝑥 𝑖 + i 𝑦 𝑖 , we choose the following -\nFigure 2: Sign of 𝑃 𝜙 , 𝜙 ( 𝑥 𝑦 , 𝜓 ) in (12) in the ( Δ 𝜙, 𝜓 ) plane. In the shaded regions 𝑃 𝜙 , 𝜙 ( 𝑥 𝑦 , 𝜓 ) &gt; 0, such that 𝑒 -𝑆 vanishes in the limit 𝑟 →∞ , while in the white regions 𝑃 𝜙 , 𝜙 ( 𝑥 𝑦 , 𝜓 ) ≤ 0.

Therefore, in a sense, they answer question (3). Additionally, step (c) allows us to generate and iterate through magic assignments of minimal structures. The main result we exploit is the following theorem.\nTheorem 1 Let H be a proper Eulerian hypergraph with valid Gram space V . Let B be any basis for V . Then,\nFIG. 3. The fourth magic set with vertex-transitive graph of compatibility that cannot be reduced to the square or pentagram that we have found, MS3-27, requires n = 3 qubits and has 27 observables and 27 contexts. It does not admit a straight line representation in the Euclidean plane. Here, observables are given by coordinate points ( x, y, z ) ∈ Z 3 3 (the x axis is horizontal, the y axis goes into the page, and the z axis is vertical) and all contexts can be obtained by applying translations to a starter context. A possible starter context β given by the observables corresponding to the coordinates (0 , 0 0) (1 0 0) (0 1 0) (0 0 1) is depicted by the , , , , , , , , , , four larger dots. All 27 contexts can be generated by applying the translations T a,b,c : Z 3 3 → Z 3 3 , 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 2 given by ( x, y, z ) → ( x + a, y + b, z + ) to each of the observables c of the starter context. For example, one obtains the context { ZY Y, XXY,ZXZ,XY Z } by applying the translation T 1 2 0 , , to the observables of β . In the example shown, all the contexts are negative. The dotted edges appear only as a visual aid to make clear the correspondence of the vertices to the coordinates. Like the magic square, see Fig. 1(a), MS3-27 can be implemented using all 3 n n -qubit Pauli observables not containing I .\n![Image](https://serverip/images/Irreducible_magic_sets_for_%24n%24-qubit_systems-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000005_4562035722b7260495c48f26ea68d76546fb8908a95d17c996836097143ddd8f.png)\n- 1.

Let  1 be the resulting graph.\n- (2) For each ordered pair ( /u1D462 /u1D44E , /u1D462 /u1D44F ) of vertices in /u1D449 (  ) such that ( /u1D462 /u1D44E , /u1D462 /u1D44F ) ∉ /u1D438 (  ) , delete each edge from a vertex in /u1D451 ( x , /u1D462 /u1D44E ) to a vertex in /u1D451 ( x , /u1D462 /u1D44F ) in  1 . Let  2 be the resulting graph.\nRecall that, by Lemma 3, | /u1D451 ( x , /u1D462 0 ) | = 1 , where /u1D462 0 is the root of  and, by Lemma 12, for each leaf /u1D462 /u1D456 of  , /u1D451 ( x , /u1D462 /u1D456 ) contains the leaf of  that has the same label as /u1D462 /u1D456 . We next obtain a graph  3 from  2 such that  3 is a subdivision of  . For each /u1D462 /u1D459 ∈ /u1D449 (  ) /uni29F5 { /u1D462 0 } , it follows from Lemma 13, that /u1D451 ( x , /u1D462 /u1D459 ) is a directed path of  and therefore, by construction, also of  2 . Let /u1D462 /u1D456 be the unique ancestor of /u1D462 /u1D459 in  . Let /u1D45D = /u1D45D 1 , /u1D45D 2 , … , /u1D45D /u1D458 be the directed path of  that is induced by /u1D451 ( x , /u1D462 /u1D456 ) and, similarly, let /u1D45D ′ = /u1D45D ′ 1 , /u1D45D ′ 2 , … , /u1D45D ′ /u1D458 ′ be the directed path of  that is induced by /u1D451 ( x , /u1D462 /u1D459 ) . By Lemma 14 and Corollary 15, there exists exactly one edge /u1D452 in  that joins a vertex of /u1D45D to a vertex of /u1D45D ′ and, in particular, /u1D452 is directed out of /u1D45D /u1D458 . Hence /u1D452 = ( /u1D45D /u1D458 , /u1D45D ′ /u1D457 ) for some 1 ≤ /u1D457 ≤ /u1D458 ′ . As /u1D462 /u1D456 is the unique parent of /u1D462 /u1D459 in  , any edge in  that is directed into a vertex in { /u1D45D ′ 1 , /u1D45D ′ 2 , /u1D45D ′ /u1D457 -1 , /u1D45D ′ /u1D457 +1 , … , /u1D45D ′ /u1D458 ′ } and does not lie on /u1D45D ′ has been deleted in Step\n(2) above. Moreover, again by Lemma 14 and Corollary 15, any edge in  that joins a vertex in /u1D451 ( x , /u1D462 /u1D459 ) with a vertex in /u1D451 ( x , /u1D462 /u1D459 ′ ) , where /u1D462 /u1D459 ′ is a child of /u1D462 /u1D459 in  , is directed out of /u1D45D ′ /u1D458 ′ . Hence, any edge in  that is directed out of a vertex in { /u1D45D ′ 1 , /u1D45D ′ 2 , … , /u1D45D ′ /u1D458 ′ -1 } and does not lie on /u1D45D ′ has also been deleted in Step (2) above. For the upcoming construction step, we call { /u1D45D ′ 1 , /u1D45D ′ 2 , … , /u1D45D ′ /u1D457 -1 } the set of dangling vertices in  2 with respect to /u1D462 /u1D459 . This set may or may not be empty. Now obtain a graph  3 from  2 by deleting the set of dangling vertices in  2 for each vertex /u1D462 /u1D459 ∈ /u1D449 (  )∖{ /u1D462 0 } . It is straightforward to check that  3 is a subdivision of  and that  can be obtained from this subdivision by suppressing each vertex with in-degree 1 and out-degree 1 in  3 . Thus, if /u1D43B ( x ) = 0 , then  displays  .\nWe complete the proof by showing that /u1D443 /u1D43C ( x ) = 0 for each 1 ≤ /u1D43C ≤ 12 .\n- ( /uni27F8 ) Suppose that  displays  . Then there exists a subset /u1D449 of /u1D449 (  ) and a subset /u1D438 of /u1D438 (  ) such that  can be obtained from  by deleting each vertex in /u1D449 and each edge in /u1D438 from  and, subsequently, suppressing any resulting vertex of in-degree 1 and out-degree 1. Without loss of generality, we choose /u1D449 such that its size | /u1D449 | is maximized. Let { /u1D462 0 , /u1D462 1 , … , /u1D462 /u1D45B  -1 } be the vertices of  , and let { /u1D463 0 , /u1D463 1 , … , /u1D463 /u1D45B  -1 } be the vertices of  . Furthermore, let  ′ be the graph obtained from  by deleting each vertex in /u1D449 and each edge in /u1D438 from  . By construction,  ′ is a subdivision of  . Consider the map /u1D45A ∶ /u1D449 (  ) → 2 /u1D449 (  ′ ) that maps each /u1D462 /u1D456 ∈ /u1D449 (  ) to a subset of /u1D449 (  ′ ) such that /u1D45A ( /u1D462 /u1D456 ) contains precisely each vertex /u1D463 /u1D457 of  ′ with /u1D436  ′ ( /u1D463 /u1D457 ) = /u1D436  ( /u1D462 /u1D456 ) . Now we define x ∈ /u1D539 /u1D45A . For each /u1D465 /u1D456,/u1D457 with 0 ≤ /u1D456 ≤ /u1D45B  - 1 and 0 ≤ /u1D457 ≤ /u1D45B  - 1 , we set /u1D465 /u1D456,/u1D457 = 1 if /u1D463 /u1D457 ∈ /u1D45A ( /u1D462 /u1D456 ) and, /u1D465 /u1D456,/u1D457 = 0 otherwise. Moreover, for each 0 ≤ /u1D457 ≤ /u1D45B  - 1 , we set /u1D465 /u1D45B  ,/u1D457 = 1 if /u1D463 /u1D457 ∈ /u1D449 and /u1D465 /u1D45B  ,/u1D457 = 0 otherwise. Lastly, to keep with the notation introduced in Section 4.1, let /u1D451 ( x , /u1D462 /u1D456 ) = /u1D45A ( /u1D462 /u1D456 ) for each /u1D456 with 0 ≤ /u1D456 ≤ /u1D45B  - 1 , and let /u1D451 ( x , /u1D462 /u1D45B  ) = /u1D449 .\n- (1) As  ′ is a subdivision of  , the root of  ′ is the only vertex of  ′ whose set of leaf descendants is /u1D44B and, so /u1D451 ( x , /u1D462 0 ) = 1 . Furthermore, by construction, /u1D451 ( x , /u1D462 /u1D456 ) &gt; 0 for each /u1D462 /u1D456 ∈ /u1D449 (  ) . By Lemma 3, /u1D443 1 ( x ) = 0 follows.\n- | | | | (2) For each vertex /u1D463 /u1D457 ∈ /u1D449 (  ′ ) there exists exactly one vertex /u1D462 /u1D456 ∈ /u1D449 (  ) such that /u1D436  ′ ( /u1D463 /u1D457 ) = /u1D436  ( /u1D462 /u1D456 ) . Moreover /u1D451 ( x , /u1D462 /u1D45B  ) = /u1D449 . Hence /u1D443 2 ( x ) = 0 follows from Lemma 4.\n- (3) Set /u1D467 /u1D456,/u1D457 = /u1D465 /u1D456,/u1D457 1 /u1D465 /u1D456,/u1D457 2 , where /u1D462 /u1D456 ∈ /u1D449 (  ) and /u1D463 /u1D457 ∈ /u1D449 (  ) is tree vertex. By Lemma 5, this implies that /u1D443 3 ( x ) = 0 . Similarly, set /u1D467 /u1D456,/u1D457 = /u1D465 /u1D456,/u1D457 1 /u1D465 /u1D456,/u1D457 2 , where /u1D462 /u1D456 ∈ /u1D449 (  ) and /u1D463 /u1D457 ∈ /u1D449 (  ) is reticulation vertex. Then, by Lemma 7, we have /u1D443 5 ( x ) = 0 . Lastly, set ̂ /u1D467 /u1D456, 2 /u1D457 = /u1D465 /u1D456,/u1D457 /u1D465 /u1D456,/u1D457 1 and ̂ /u1D467 /u1D456, 2 +1 /u1D457 = /u1D465 /u1D456,/u1D457 /u1D465 /u1D456,/u1D457 2 , where /u1D462 /u1D456 ∈ /u1D449 (  ) and /u1D463 /u1D457 ∈ /u1D449 (  ) is a tree vertex. It then follows by Lemma 10 that /u1D443 8 ( x ) = 0 .\n- (4) Since  ′ is a subdivision of  , it follows from the definition of /u1D45A (and consequently /u1D451 ) that, for each 0 ≤ /u1D456 ≤ /u1D45B  -1 , the subgraphof  that is induced by the vertices in /u1D451 ( x , /u1D462 /u1D456 ) is a directed path. Now, towards a contradiction, assume that there exist a vertex /u1D462 /u1D456 in  and a vertex /u1D463 /u1D457 in  such that {{ /u1D463 /u1D457 , /u1D450 1 ( /u1D463 /u1D457 ) , /u1D450 2 ( /u1D463 /u1D457 )} ⊆ /u1D451 ( x , /u1D462 /u1D456 ) . Since the subgraph of  that is induced by the vertices in /u1D451 ( x , /u1D462 /u1D456 ) is a directed path, we may assume without loss of generality that there is a directed path ( /u1D450 1 ( /u1D463 /u1D457 ) = /u1D45D 1 , /u1D45D 2 , … , /u1D45D /u1D458 = /u1D450 2 ( /u1D463 /u1D457 )) in  with /u1D458 ≥ 2 . In particular, each vertex on this path is contained in /u1D451 ( x , /u1D462 /u1D456 ) . It now follows that we can obtain a subdivision of  from  by deleting all vertices in /u1D449 ∪ { /u1D45D 1 , /u1D45D 2 , … , /u1D45D /u1D458 -1 } and edges in\n\n### **参考文献**\n[1] Irreducible_magic_sets_for_$n$-qubit_systems - https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13141\n[2] A_QUBO_formulation_for_the_Tree_Containment_problem - https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11234\n[3] Parametrized_constant-depth_quantum_neuron - https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12496\n\n请提供一个专业性的回答。", "completion": ""}

Integration cycles in two dimensions\n\nLet us consider the following straightforward extension of the model (6) to two degrees of freedom, 𝑧 1 and 𝑧 2:\n\n$$S = \\frac { \\lambda _ { l } } { 4 } ( z _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } + z _ { 2 }$$\nwhere we once more parametrize 𝜆 𝑙 as in (6). The concept of integration cycles is generalized to 𝑑 dimensions rather straightforwardly as 𝑑 -dimensional integration paths in C 𝑑 that either connect two distinct zeros of 𝑒 -𝑆 or are closed and incontractible. As before, in the model (10) we do not need to worry about the latter, nor about finite zeros, as 𝑒 -𝑆 has no singularities and only vanishes as | 𝑧 𝑖 | →∞ . In particular, there are zeros whenever Re 𝑆 →∞ as | 𝑧 𝑖 | →∞ . To find the independent integration cycles of (10), we shall first determine these zeros.\nIntroducing the real and imaginary parts of 𝑧 𝑖 as 𝑧 𝑖 = 𝑥 𝑖 + i 𝑦 𝑖 , we choose the following -\nFigure 2: Sign of 𝑃 𝜙 , 𝜙 ( 𝑥 𝑦 , 𝜓 ) in (12) in the ( Δ 𝜙, 𝜓 ) plane.

{"prompt": "请基于以下上下文，回答用户的问题。\n\n**用户问题：**\nT-carbon 的二维结构是否适合构建表面码所需的量子比特阵列？其电子特性（如自旋 - 轨道耦合）对纠错有何影响？\n\n**上下文：**\nWe are going to use the default PauliNet architecture and change the basis set to the correlation-consistent family [60], starting from cc-pvdz to cc-pv5z. The first step is to define a Molecule object (for example named LiH ) with the geometry of LiH at an internuclear distance of 3 0141132 Bohr, and a total zero . charge and spin. Then, the PauliNet neural network can be initialized for a given basis set, say ccpvdz, from a Hartree-Fock calculation using the function from hf(LiH, basis='cc-pvdz') , meaning that the ansatz contains a single Slater determinant (cfr. Equation (33)) and uses the HF orbitals. After initialization, the network can be trained using the function train(net) , where net is the neural network object returned from the initialization procedure. This is the most expensive part of the calculation, however, the training parameters can be slightly modified to decrease the computation time, and still obtain reasonably optimized network weights (with an uncertainty of around 1 m E h ). We suggest you to use n steps = 500 , batch size = 500 and epoch size = 20 . The last step to obtain the ground state energy of LiH is to call the function evaluate(net) . Similarly to train(net) , evaluate(net) accepts optional parameters defining the number of Monte Carlo sweeps and the length of the Markov chain sampled at each step. For these two, we suggest the following values, n steps = 400 and sample size\n= 800 . Save the obtained energy and the estimated error, and repeat the same process for the other basis sets. The choice of training parameters was such that the optimization does not take too long time. If you want to investigate the effects of the training procedure on the final energy and uncertainty, as an advanced exercise you can modify the values of n steps and batch size in the train(net) function (hint: modify one value at a time to understand their role).\n## 3.2.2 CCSD(T) calculations\nIn this part we are going to perform CCSD(T) calculations in combination with the four basis sets used above. You can use PySCF for performing these calculations, and they should take significantly less time than the PauliNet ones. PySCF has a pretty extensive user guide available online at https://pyscf.org/, with many examples. We suggest you to have a look at it if you get stuck at any point. The first step is again to define the lithium hydride molecule, this time in a data-structure that PySCF understands. This can be done with the function gto.M(...) , which accepts a number of arguments similar to the construction of the Molecule object for the DeepQMC package. Then, you can create a restricted HF instance with rhf = scf.RHF(mol) , where mol is the molecule you just created (hint: make sure to set the correct basis set with mol.basis = 'cc-pvdz' and build it with mol.build() ). The rhf object can be used to create the coupled cluster instance with cc = cc.CCSD(rhf) . The energy for each method can then be obtained by calling .kernel() on the HF and coupled cluster objects, and .ccsd t() for the perturbative triples correction. Save all these energies and repeat the process for all basis sets. If you have a powerful computer, as an additional exercise you can try to compute the full CI energy, however, you will probably be able to get it at most with the triple zeta basis set (hint: for such a small molecule, the CCSD(T) and FCI energies are very similar).\n## 3.2.3 Comparison of PauliNet and CCSD(T)\n- [21] T.

Smolensky (1990), the author suggests using a representation based on tensor product :   Tensor   Product   Representation   (TPR),   to   capture   syntactic bindings across sentences. [49, 50] Tensor product is here understood as the Kronecker product, denoted by . Given two matrices A, B we define A B to be ⊗ ⊗ the block matrix where every element of A is multiplied by B (Fig. 2.1). TPR is a structure where every unit of a sentence can be part of the representation of every constituent. It can be compositionally encoded from the numerical vectors representing the composing words, and hence offers the ideal framework to build-up a structure to embed not only words, but also sentences.\n$$\\begin{array} { c c c } a _ { 1 1 } B & \\cdots & a _ { 1 n } B \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ a _ { m 1 } B & \\cdots & a _ { m n } B \\end{array}$$\nBased on Lambek's pregroup algebra, in Mehrnoosh et al. (2010), the authors introduce the CSC algorithm, which develops another implementation of tensor based representation of the meaning of a sentence. [34] This algorithm can be implemented on a quantum computer. Let the linear map Σ⟨ ii| (Fig. 2.2), which is the sum over all the basis vectors of the space N. We call this linear map a cap . It formally describes the state of log  EPR pairs (a generalization of n quantum entanglement). If the basis is of size n and is orthonormal, the cap can simply be thought of as a row vector of size n 2 , filled of 0, and valued 1 at the positions  ii|. The steps of the CSC algorithm are detailed in Fig. 2.3. ⟨\n$$\\sum _ { i } \\langle i | \\colon =$$\n\nFig. 2.2 (Zeng &amp; Coecke, 2016) : Definition of a cap\n- 1 Compute the tensor product words Wo wk in the order that each word appears in the sentence\n- 2 Construct a linear map that represents the grammatical type reduction by the vectors with the appropriate caps.

When compared to classical process, quantum provides advantage in runtime, space complexity i.e. number of bits/qubits required for image encoding, but is not sufficient in terms of depth and width of image. With Quantum methods it is quite challenging to handle larger images as circuit design gets complex with increased number of qubits required, leading to addition of noise with inaccurate edge detection and classification results. In this project, we have used gate based quantum statevector and qasm simulator that are slower in performance which in-turn increases the training time for larger datasets and requires splitting of data into smaller sets and recombining to get higher accuracy for larger image pixel and datasets. While running real quantum may provides better performance but it is more exposed to the noise from the devices. As advancements with this projects, our team is working to analyse impact of different noise models on the quantum image encoding circuit and its results when processing smaller pixel as well as large pixel images. Our work in future will include implementing from quantum processed results for image verification with original/real-time images to reach better accuracy.\n## REFERENCES\n- [1] Yue Ruan, Xiling Xue, and Yuanxia Shen.

Our results capture the evolution of the electron's wavefunction at the 2000th time step, illustrating distinct standing wave patterns and probability densities that validate quantum mechanical predictions. Additionally, both 2D and 3D simulations across multiple time steps reveal the dynamic nature of quantum superposition and interference within the well. These findings underscore the method's stability and accuracy, offering a robust tool for exploring quantum phenomena in constrained quantum systems\n\n### **参考文献**\n[1] Numerical_Simulation_of_the_Time-Dependent_Schrodinger_Equation_Using_the_Crank-Nicolson_Method - https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10060\n[2] Quantum_Image_Processing - https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01831\n[3] Quantum_many-body_simulations_with_PauliStrings.jl - https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09654\n[4] Parametrized_constant-depth_quantum_neuron - https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12496\n\n请提供一个专业性的回答。", "completion": ""}

For a comprehensive overview see for instance Refs. [26, 27]. Relying on an iterative exchange of information between a classical and a quantum computer, these algorithms allow to work with shallower quantum circuits of constant depth in time. In particular, Li and Benjamin [28] first showed how to use a variational principle to simulate the real time dynamics of quantum systems and applied it to a quantum Ising model.\n## 2 Wavepacket dynamics in position space\n\nIn this work, we study the wavepacket dynamics governed by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE)\n$$i \\hbar { \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial t } } \\psi ( x, t ) = H ( x ) \\, \\psi ( x, t ) \\quad \\quad ( 1 )$$\nwhere x is a spacial dimension mapped here to a one or two-dimensional grid. The wavefunction is normalized, ∫ | ψ x, t ( ) | 2 dx = 1 , so that the | ψ x, t ( ) | 2 becomes the probability probability for finding the system at position x of the grid at time t . The time variable is considered as a continuous parameter. The Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) is given by\n$$H ( x ) = - \\frac { \\hbar { ^ } { 2 } } { 2 m } \\nabla ^ { 2 } + V ( x ) \\quad \\quad ( 2 )$$\nHere, -e and g n ≈ 3 826 are the electron charge and the neutron . g -factor, respectively, P ⊥ ( q ) is the 3 × 3 matrix, P ⊥ αβ ( q ) = δ αβ -q α β q /q 2 (with α, β = x, y, z ), which is a projector on to the plane perpendicular to the direction of q , and χ ( q q , ; ω ) is the 3 × 3 spin susceptibility matrix (see, e.g., Sec. 5.7 in Ref. [45]). The poles of S ( q , ω ) occur at frequencies of magnons and Stoner excitations. This quantity is accessible from linear-response theory, and in the following we will show how it can be computed efficiently using the LL approach to TDDFpT. Hereafter, Hartree atomic units will be used, and the formalism is presented for insulating systems while the generalization to metals can be found in Appendix B of Ref. [46] and in Ref. [47].\n## 2.2. Time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory\n\nMagnetic excitations in solids can be modeled using the time-dependent Pauli-type Kohn-Sham (KS) equations of TDDFT that read:\n$$i \\frac { \\partial \\Psi _ { n, k } ( \\mathbf r, t ) } { \\partial t } = \\hat { H } ( t ) \\Psi _ { n, k } ( \\mathbf r, t ), \\quad \\quad \\quad$$\nwhere n and k are the electronic band index and the crystal momentum, respectively, Ψ n, k ( r , t ) are the twocomponent time-dependent KS spinor wave functions, and ˆ ( H t ) is the time-dependent Hamiltonian operator of the system [48]. It is often convenient to use perturbation theory to first order within TDDFT (i.e. TDDFpT) what is also known as the linear-response TDDFT. Moreover, Eq. (3) is often solved in the frequency domain rather than in the time domain. Therefore, it can be shown that but linearizing Eq. (3) and by making a Fourier transform from the time domain to the frequency domain we can obtain the following set of the so-called resonant and anti-resonant Pauli-type linear-response KS (Sternheimer) equations [46, 47]:\n$$\\left ( \\hat { H } ^ { \\circ } _ { k + q } - \\varepsilon ^ { \\circ } _ { n, k } - \\omega \\right ) \\tilde { U } ^ { \\prime } _ { n, k + q } ( \\$$\nThe classical field ψ ( r , t ) varies slowly in time and space and satisfies a non-linear Schr¨dinger o equation, the so called Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE)\n$$H = \\int \\mathcal { H } d ^ { 3 } \\mathbf r = \\int \\left [ \\frac { \\hslash ^ { 2 } } { 2 m } \\nabla \\psi ( \\mathbf r, t ) \\cdot \\nabla \\psi ^ { * } ( \\mathbf r, t ) + \\frac { \\lambda } { 2 } | \\psi ( \\mathbf r, t ) | ^ { 4 } \\right ] d ^ { 3 } \\mathbf r, \\\\ \\mathrm \\leqslant \\| \\psi ( \\mathbf r, t ) \\| \\text {varies slowly in time and space and satisfies a non-linear Schrodinger$$\n$$i \\hbar { \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial t } } \\psi ( \\mathbf r, t ) = \\frac { \\delta H } { \\delta \\psi ^ { * } ( \\mathbf r, t ) } = - \\frac { \\hbar { ^ } { 2 } } { 2 m } \\nabla ^ { 2 } \\psi ( \\mathbf r, t ) + \\lambda | \\psi ( \\mathbf r, t ) | ^ { 2 } \\psi ( \\mathbf r, t ). \\quad \\quad ( 4 ) \\ \\\\ \\tan, i t i s e a s y \\, to \\, \\mathrm o b t a n { c o n s e v a t i o n } \\, { \\mathrm a w s a t i o n } \\, { \\mathrm a t i c l e }$$\n( ) From this equation, it is easy to obtain conservation laws about the particle number, energy and momentum\n$$\\frac { \\partial } { \\partial t } \\rho + \\nabla \\cdot j = 0, \\\\ \\frac { \\partial } { 3 } \\mathcal { H } + \\nabla \\cdot \\vec { \\mathcal { P } } = 0,$$\n\n### **参考文献**\n[1] turboMagnon_--_A_code_for_the_simulation_of_spin-wave_spectra_using_the_Liouville-Lanczos_approach_to_time-dependent_density-functional_perturbation_theory - https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01120\n[2] A_topological_realization_of_spin_polarization_through_vortex_formation_in_collisions_of_Bose-Einstein_condensates - https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13300\n[3] Quantum_algorithms_for_grid-based_variational_time_evolution - https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02521\n\n请提供一个专业性的回答。", "completion": ""}

The trial wavefunction defined on this manifold | ψ ( θ ( )) t 〉 is parameterized by a set of n p time-dependent parameters, θ ( ) t = { θ 1 ( ) t , ..., θ n p ( ) t } . A time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) defines the optimal evolution of the parameters within the submanifold of the full Hilbert space. There exist different formulations of the TDVP. For Kähler manifolds, i. e., when the tangent space is a complex subspace [34], all the different formulations lead to the same equations of motion for the variational parameters. However, this is not the case for unitary parameterizations of the type\n$$| \\psi ( \\theta ( t ) ) \\rangle = U ( \\theta ( t ) ) \\, | \\phi \\rangle \\,,$$\nwhere | φ 〉 is a reference state and U ( θ ( )) t is a unitary operator (e.g., the quantum circuit) depending on real parameters θ ( ) t [34]. In this case, the equations of motion differ and hold distinct properties such as the conservation of the norm or the energy. Recent works [26, 31, 32, 33, 34] promoted the use of the equations of motion derived from the McLachlan variational principle due to of their higher numerical stability [34]. For a given Hamiltonian H , these equations, when accounting for a global phase mismatch (see Ref.

The trial wavefunction defined on this manifold | ψ ( θ ( )) t 〉 is parameterized by a set of n p time-dependent parameters, θ ( ) t = { θ 1 ( ) t , ..., θ n p ( ) t } . A time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) defines the optimal evolution of the parameters within the submanifold of the full Hilbert space. There exist different formulations of the TDVP. For Kähler manifolds, i. e., when the tangent space is a complex subspace [34], all the different formulations lead to the same equations of motion for the variational parameters. However, this is not the case for unitary parameterizations of the type\n$$| \\psi ( \\theta ( t ) ) \\rangle = U ( \\theta ( t ) ) \\, | \\phi \\rangle \\,,$$\nwhere | φ 〉 is a reference state and U ( θ ( )) t is a unitary operator (e.g., the quantum circuit) depending on real parameters θ ( ) t [34]. In this case, the equations of motion differ and hold distinct properties such as the conservation of the norm or the energy. Recent works [26, 31, 32, 33, 34] promoted the use of the equations of motion derived from the McLachlan variational principle due to of their higher numerical stability [34]. For a given Hamiltonian H , these equations, when accounting for a global phase mismatch (see Ref. [26] for a thorough derivation), read\n$$\\mathrm F \\dot { \\theta } = V \\,,$$\n\nwith\n$$H _ { C } = \\sum _ { z \\in \\{ 0, 1 \\} ^ { n } } C ( z ) | z \\rangle \\langle z |$$\nin terms of local terms, and a parametrized family { U G ( θ ) } θ ∈ Θ of n -qubit unitary circuits. The later might be parametrized by the underlying graph of the cost function or in case of hardware-efficient algorithms tailored to the physical device [12]. The parametrized family give rise to variational ansatz states\n$$| \\Psi ( \\theta ) \\rangle = U _ { G } ( \\theta ) | 0 \\rangle ^ { \\otimes n } \\,.$$\nthat can be prepared with U G ( θ ) from a product state | 0 〉 ⊗ n . Measuring Ψ( ) in the θ computational basis then provides a sample z ∈ { 0 1 , } n from the distribution p z ( ) = |〈 z | Ψ( ) θ 〉| 2 such that the expectation value of the associated cost function is equal to the energy E [ C z ( )] = 〈 Ψ( ) θ | H C | Ψ( ) θ 〉 of the state Ψ( θ ) with respect to H C . Thus the problem of maximizing C is translated to that of finding a value of the (vector of) parameters θ maximizing the energy of Ψ( θ ). The latter step is envisioned to be performed e.g., by numerical gradient descent or a similar classical procedure prescribing (iteratively) what parameters θ to try. The computation of this prescription (according to obtained measurement results) is the classical processing part of the quantum algorithm leading to the term hybrid . We will refer to this form of algorithm as a 'bare' hybrid algorithm in the following.\nThe potential utility of this approach hinges on a number of factors. Of primary importance - beyond questions of convergence or efficiency - is whether the family { Ψ( ) θ } θ ∈ Θ of\n\n### **参考文献**\n[1] A_Variational_Quantum_Algorithm_For_Approximating_Convex_Roofs - https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02099\n[2] Quantum_algorithms_for_grid-based_variational_time_evolution - https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02521\n[3] Twisted_hybrid_algorithms_for_combinatorial_optimization - https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00717\n\n请提供一个专业性的回答。", "completion": ""}

Thus PauliStrings.jl performs significantly better than TEBD for Heisenberg time evolution of the next-nearest neighbor XXZ chain.\n## 4. Integration cycles in two dimensions\n\nLet us consider the following straightforward extension of the model (6) to two degrees of freedom, 𝑧 1 and 𝑧 2:\n\n$$S = \\frac { \\lambda _ { l } } { 4 } ( z _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } + z _ { 2 }$$\nwhere we once more parametrize 𝜆 𝑙 as in (6). The concept of integration cycles is generalized to 𝑑 dimensions rather straightforwardly as 𝑑 -dimensional integration paths in C 𝑑 that either connect two distinct zeros of 𝑒 -𝑆 or are closed and incontractible. As before, in the model (10) we do not need to worry about the latter, nor about finite zeros, as 𝑒 -𝑆 has no singularities and only vanishes as | 𝑧 𝑖 | →∞ . In particular, there are zeros whenever Re 𝑆 →∞ as | 𝑧 𝑖 | →∞ . To find the independent integration cycles of (10), we shall first determine these zeros.\nIntroducing the real and imaginary parts of 𝑧 𝑖 as 𝑧 𝑖 = 𝑥 𝑖 + i 𝑦 𝑖 , we choose the following -\nFigure 2: Sign of 𝑃 𝜙 , 𝜙 ( 𝑥 𝑦 , 𝜓 ) in (12) in the ( Δ 𝜙, 𝜓 ) plane.

{"prompt": "请基于以下上下文，回答用户的问题。\n\n**用户问题：**\nT-carbon 的能带结构图表如何揭示其拓扑特性？与石墨烯的能带图有何关键区别？\n\n**上下文：**\nWe are going to use the default PauliNet architecture and change the basis set to the correlation-consistent family [60], starting from cc-pvdz to cc-pv5z. The first step is to define a Molecule object (for example named LiH ) with the geometry of LiH at an internuclear distance of 3 0141132 Bohr, and a total zero . charge and spin. Then, the PauliNet neural network can be initialized for a given basis set, say ccpvdz, from a Hartree-Fock calculation using the function from hf(LiH, basis='cc-pvdz') , meaning that the ansatz contains a single Slater determinant (cfr. Equation (33)) and uses the HF orbitals. After initialization, the network can be trained using the function train(net) , where net is the neural network object returned from the initialization procedure. This is the most expensive part of the calculation, however, the training parameters can be slightly modified to decrease the computation time, and still obtain reasonably optimized network weights (with an uncertainty of around 1 m E h ). We suggest you to use n steps = 500 , batch size = 500 and epoch size = 20 . The last step to obtain the ground state energy of LiH is to call the function evaluate(net) . Similarly to train(net) , evaluate(net) accepts optional parameters defining the number of Monte Carlo sweeps and the length of the Markov chain sampled at each step. For these two, we suggest the following values, n steps = 400 and sample size\n= 800 . Save the obtained energy and the estimated error, and repeat the same process for the other basis sets. The choice of training parameters was such that the optimization does not take too long time. If you want to investigate the effects of the training procedure on the final energy and uncertainty, as an advanced exercise you can modify the values of n steps and batch size in the train(net) function (hint: modify one value at a time to understand their role).\n## 3.2.2 CCSD(T) calculations\nIn this part we are going to perform CCSD(T) calculations in combination with the four basis sets used above. You can use PySCF for performing these calculations, and they should take significantly less time than the PauliNet ones. PySCF has a pretty extensive user guide available online at https://pyscf.org/, with many examples. We suggest you to have a look at it if you get stuck at any point. The first step is again to define the lithium hydride molecule, this time in a data-structure that PySCF understands. This can be done with the function gto.M(...) , which accepts a number of arguments similar to the construction of the Molecule object for the DeepQMC package. Then, you can create a restricted HF instance with rhf = scf.RHF(mol) , where mol is the molecule you just created (hint: make sure to set the correct basis set with mol.basis = 'cc-pvdz' and build it with mol.build() ). The rhf object can be used to create the coupled cluster instance with cc = cc.CCSD(rhf) . The energy for each method can then be obtained by calling .kernel() on the HF and coupled cluster objects, and .ccsd t() for the perturbative triples correction. Save all these energies and repeat the process for all basis sets. If you have a powerful computer, as an additional exercise you can try to compute the full CI energy, however, you will probably be able to get it at most with the triple zeta basis set (hint: for such a small molecule, the CCSD(T) and FCI energies are very similar).\n## 3.2.3 Comparison of PauliNet and CCSD(T)\nIn P. Smolensky (1990), the author suggests using a representation based on tensor product :   Tensor   Product   Representation   (TPR),   to   capture   syntactic bindings across sentences. [49, 50] Tensor product is here understood as the Kronecker product, denoted by . Given two matrices A, B we define A B to be ⊗ ⊗ the block matrix where every element of A is multiplied by B (Fig. 2.1). TPR is a structure where every unit of a sentence can be part of the representation of every constituent. It can be compositionally encoded from the numerical vectors representing the composing words, and hence offers the ideal framework to build-up a structure to embed not only words, but also sentences.\n$$\\begin{array} { c c c } a _ { 1 1 } B & \\cdots & a _ { 1 n } B \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ a _ { m 1 } B & \\cdots & a _ { m n } B \\end{array}$$\nBased on Lambek's pregroup algebra, in Mehrnoosh et al. (2010), the authors introduce the CSC algorithm, which develops another implementation of tensor based representation of the meaning of a sentence. [34] This algorithm can be implemented on a quantum computer. Let the linear map Σ⟨ ii| (Fig. 2.2), which is the sum over all the basis vectors of the space N. We call this linear map a cap . It formally describes the state of log  EPR pairs (a generalization of n quantum entanglement). If the basis is of size n and is orthonormal, the cap can simply be thought of as a row vector of size n 2 , filled of 0, and valued 1 at the positions  ii|. The steps of the CSC algorithm are detailed in Fig. 2.3. ⟨\n$$\\sum _ { i } \\langle i | \\colon =$$\n\nFig. 2.2 (Zeng &amp; Coecke, 2016) : Definition of a cap\n- 1 Compute the tensor product words Wo wk in the order that each word appears in the sentence\n- 2 Construct a linear map that represents the grammatical type reduction by the vectors with the appropriate caps.

The concept of integration cycles is generalized to 𝑑 dimensions rather straightforwardly as 𝑑 -dimensional integration paths in C 𝑑 that either connect two distinct zeros of 𝑒 -𝑆 or are closed and incontractible. As before, in the model (10) we do not need to worry about the latter, nor about finite zeros, as 𝑒 -𝑆 has no singularities and only vanishes as | 𝑧 𝑖 | →∞ . In particular, there are zeros whenever Re 𝑆 →∞ as | 𝑧 𝑖 | →∞ . To find the independent integration cycles of (10), we shall first determine these zeros.\nIntroducing the real and imaginary parts of 𝑧 𝑖 as 𝑧 𝑖 = 𝑥 𝑖 + i 𝑦 𝑖 , we choose the following -\nFigure 2: Sign of 𝑃 𝜙 , 𝜙 ( 𝑥 𝑦 , 𝜓 ) in (12) in the ( Δ 𝜙, 𝜓 ) plane.

The concept of integration cycles is generalized to 𝑑 dimensions rather straightforwardly as 𝑑 -dimensional integration paths in C 𝑑 that either connect two distinct zeros of 𝑒 -𝑆 or are closed and incontractible. As before, in the model (10) we do not need to worry about the latter, nor about finite zeros, as 𝑒 -𝑆 has no singularities and only vanishes as | 𝑧 𝑖 | →∞ . In particular, there are zeros whenever Re 𝑆 →∞ as | 𝑧 𝑖 | →∞ . To find the independent integration cycles of (10), we shall first determine these zeros.\nIntroducing the real and imaginary parts of 𝑧 𝑖 as 𝑧 𝑖 = 𝑥 𝑖 + i 𝑦 𝑖 , we choose the following -\nFigure 2: Sign of 𝑃 𝜙 , 𝜙 ( 𝑥 𝑦 , 𝜓 ) in (12) in the ( Δ 𝜙, 𝜓 ) plane. In the shaded regions 𝑃 𝜙 , 𝜙 ( 𝑥 𝑦 , 𝜓 ) &gt; 0, such that 𝑒 -𝑆 vanishes in the limit 𝑟 →∞ , while in the white regions 𝑃 𝜙 , 𝜙 ( 𝑥 𝑦 , 𝜓 ) ≤ 0. The real and imaginary integration cycles in these coordinates are marked as full and dashed lines, respectively.\n![Image](https://serverip/images/Kernels_and_integration_cycles_in_complex_Langevin_simulations-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000003_d83dbf800617ef4b9103869efbe05c697f02f1ba1917a026522a0de5670d09ce.png)\n\nconvenient, but perhaps unusual - parametrization:\n\n### **参考文献**\n[1] Kernels_and_integration_cycles_in_complex_Langevin_simulations - https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13423\n[2] Quantum_many-body_simulations_with_PauliStrings.jl - https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09654\n[3] Parametrized_constant-depth_quantum_neuron - https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12496\n\n请提供一个专业性的回答。", "completion": ""}

Therefore, that quantum neuron framework applies the kernel trick and activates following a non-deterministic function of the computed inner product, which was to be shown. To instantiate a quantum neuron, one only needs to realize a feature mapping Φ( ) by · means of the operators E and D .\n## 2.1 Binary-Valued Quantum Neuron\nThe following is a code example of noisy time evolution implementation in PauliStrings.jl used to generate Fig. 1:\n```\n✞ # heisenberg evolution of the operator O using rk4 # return tr(O(0)*O(t))/tr(O(t)^2) # M is the number of strings to keep at each step # noise is the amplitude of depolarizing noise function evolve(H, O, M, times, noise) S = [] O0 = deepcopy(O) dt = times[2]-times[1] for t in times push!(S, ps.trace(O*ps.dagger(O0))/ps.trace(O0*O0)) #preform one step of rk4, keep only M strings, do not discard O0 O = ps.rk4(H, O, dt; heisenberg=true, M=M, keep=O0) #add depolarizing noise O = ps.add_noise(O, noise*dt) # keep the M strings with the largest weight. Do not discard O0 O = ps.trim(O, M; keep=O0) end return real.(S) end ✝\n```\n☎\n\n✆\nAchieving time evolution at this system size with dense or sparse matrices would require a large amount of distributed memory, making it very computationally expensive to run. On the other hand, using TEBD as shown in Fig. 4 we are able to get converged results with 9 Gb of memory but only up to t ∼ 1 in 4 days runtime. The PauliStrings.jl result with M = 2 18 and ϵ = 0 01 . is shown for comparison and displays the expected decay to an order of magnitude longer time ( t ∼ 10 ), though it only required 5 Gb of memory and 1 day of runtime. The TEBD results shown use a truncation cutoff of 10 -10 ; we also performed the same simulation for both larger and smaller\ncutoffs, but found 10 -10 to be more than sufficiently converged while larger cutoffs did not improve accessible simulation times without significant loss of accuracy. Thus PauliStrings.jl performs significantly better than TEBD for Heisenberg time evolution of the next-nearest neighbor XXZ chain.\n![Image](https://serverip/images/Kernels_and_integration_cycles_in_complex_Langevin_simulations-with-image-refs_artifacts/image_000003_d83dbf800617ef4b9103869efbe05c697f02f1ba1917a026522a0de5670d09ce.png)\n\nconvenient, but perhaps unusual - parametrization:\n$$x _ { 1 } = r _ { x } \\cos ( \\phi _ { x } ) \\, \\ \\ x _ { 2 } = r _ { x } \\sin ( \\phi _ { x } ) \\, \\ \\ r _ { x } = r \\cos ( \\psi ) \\, \\ \\ y _ { 1 } = r _ { y } \\cos ( \\phi _ { y } ) \\, \\ \\ y _ { 2 } = r _ { y } \\sin ( \\phi _ { y } ) \\, \\ \\ r _ { y } = r \\sin ( \\psi )$$\nsuch that 𝜓 = arctan GLYPH&lt;16&gt; 𝑟 𝑦 𝑟 𝑥 GLYPH&lt;17&gt; ∈ GLYPH&lt;2&gt; 0 , 𝜋 2 GLYPH&lt;3&gt; . Inserting (11) back into (10), we obtain the following expression for the real part of 𝑆 , again assuming 𝜆 𝑙 = 1 without loss of generality:\n$$R e \\, S = r ^ { 4 } P ( \\phi _ { x }, \\phi _ { y }, \\psi ) \\,, \\ \\ P ( \\phi _ { x }, \\phi _ { y }, \\psi ) = \\cos ^ { 2 } ( 2 \\psi ) - \\sin ^ { 2 } ( 2 \\psi ) \\cos ^ { 2 } ( \\phi _ { x } - \\phi _ { y } ) \\,. \\quad ( 1 2 )$$\nNotice how the latter expression depends only on the difference Δ 𝜙 : = 𝜙 𝑥 -𝜙 𝑦 , which nicely reflects the O 2 ( ) symmetry of (10). We have thus reduced the problem of finding the zeros of 𝑒 -𝑆 to the problem of finding regions in ( Δ 𝜙, 𝜓 ) space where 𝑃 𝜙 , 𝜙 ( 𝑥 𝑦 , 𝜓 ) &gt; 0. We show a plot of the sign of 𝑃 𝜙 , 𝜙 ( 𝑥 𝑦 , 𝜓 ) in Fig. 2.\n\n### **参考文献**\n[1] Kernels_and_integration_cycles_in_complex_Langevin_simulations - https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13423\n[2] Quantum_many-body_simulations_with_PauliStrings.jl - https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09654\n[3] Parametrized_constant-depth_quantum_neuron - https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12496\n\n请提供一个专业性的回答。", "completion": ""}
